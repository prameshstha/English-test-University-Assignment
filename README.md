# English-test-University-Assignment
University Assignment in python

This is an “English Test” program in which the user is presented with a word and then asked to answer
a simple question about the word. The user can choose the number words. After some words, the program shows the user’s score and ends. The
words are selected at random from the list of words in the starter file (english_test.py).

For each of the words, the program randomly selects one of the following 4 questions to ask:
1) How many letters does the word contain?
2) How many vowels does the word contain?
3) How many consonants does the word contain?
4) What is letter # of the word? (# is a number, e.g. “What is letter 3 of the word?”)
Once the user enters their answer, the program determines if it is correct before printing an
appropriate message (“Correct!” / “Incorrect!”) and continuing to the next word. A correct answer
gains 1 point, resulting in a final score between 0 to the number the user selected, which the program displays before ending
